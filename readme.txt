This will take a disk image (or any file with with data in it, really), carve out every file of the type that you specify, and export those files to the specified directory. This will work for recovering deleted files, unless they have been overwritten.

Below are the files that this program is currently capable of carving:
- Jpeg
- Png
- Zip
- Modern Office Files (docx, pptx, xlsx)

More will be added soon.
